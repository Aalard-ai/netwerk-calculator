# Network Transfer Calculator 🚀

A modern, "vibe-coded" tool to estimate file transfer durations across various network speeds.

## 🛠 Features
- **Accurate Math:** Uses decimal-based units (1 TB = 1,000 GB) to match networking standards.
- **Real-World Estimation:** Automatically calculates a "Real World" result by accounting for a 10% TCP/IP protocol overhead.
- **Unit Flexibility:** Supports MB, GB, and TB for file sizes, and Mbps to 10 Gbps for link speeds.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive design with a clean, professional look.

## 📈 Why the 10% overhead?
In networking, the "Theoretical" speed is rarely achieved. Protocol overhead (headers, acknowledgments) typically consumes about 5-10% of the available bandwidth. This tool helps you plan migrations more realistically by factoring in this loss.
